# Liney
##### Base Line Height Helpers & Guide Bookmarklet

## Getting Started
Firstly you should copy the liney directory into your own Sass architecture. I personally have a third party directory which is included before my own styles.

Create a `_liney-settings.scss` and replace the examples with the necessary styles you need.

Finally, if you're using Gulp to parse your Sass I suggest adding `gulp-combine-mq` to merge repeating media queries.
